"""SEC EDGAR filing text fetch + results-section extraction + XBRL financial facts.

Filing metadata (ticker, form_type, accession_number, item_codes,
primary_doc_url, ...) is owned entirely by news-retrieval: its poller fetches
from EDGAR daily and stores in DynamoDB (`ocn-sec-filings`), read via
GET /market/sec-filings/{ticker} (see adapters/news_client.get_sec_filings).
signal-detection-agent does not call EDGAR's submissions API itself - only
the functions here remain, since fetching a filing's full body text (and,
for 10-K/10-Q, its structured XBRL facts) is not something news-retrieval
does (it stores metadata + a link only).

    companyfacts already carries every revenue concept's full multi-year
    history (confirmed empirically: the same us-gaap/RevenueFromContract...
    data this function reads is identical to what
    data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/.../Revenues.json would return for
    the same CIK).

    Built to let the model judge THIS quarter's growth against the company's
    OWN recent trend, not a fixed absolute-growth threshold - a fixed >10%
    band means a company that grows 60%+ every quarter (e.g. a high-growth
    filer) is permanently flagged "high" for being normal, while a company
    whose growth suddenly drops from 60% to 12% (a real deceleration) reads
    as unremarkable under the same fixed band despite the second case being
    the one that actually changed. Deviation from trailing average is what
    the model needs to tell "normal for this company" from "something broke".

    Only quarterly-length entries (~91 days, via _TARGET_PERIOD_DAYS) are
    returned, ALWAYS - even for a 10-K - since annual filings need the same
    quarter-over-quarter trend as 10-Qs to judge Q4 deviation; the 10-K's own
    full-year figure is not comparable to a list of quarters and is already
    available separately via extract_xbrl_facts_for_filing()'s 'revenue'
    field for that form type.

    Strictly BEFORE period_of_report (not <=) so the current filing's own
    period is never included as one of its own trailing quarters - only
    entries with a distinct, earlier end date fall in the "trailing" window.
    Deduplicated by end date (a quarter can be tagged under multiple later
    accessions as a comparative figure; only the value closest to a 91-day
    period is kept per end date, and if several accessions report an
    identical quarter, any one is representative since restatements are rare
    and out of scope here).

    Returns {"quarters": [{end, value, yoy_growth_pct}, ...], "trailing_average_yoy_growth_pct":
    float | None} - oldest quarter first, capped at the 8 most recent ("8" is
    deliberately quarters, not a trailing-year lookback, so it covers ~2
    fiscal years regardless of form type). yoy_growth_pct per quarter and the
    trailing average are computed HERE, not left for the model - confirmed
    empirically this session that gpt-4.1 gets this arithmetic wrong on real
    filings (substituting sequential quarter-over-quarter ratios for true
    year-over-year ratios), so the model should use these values verbatim
    rather than recompute them from the raw quarter list.
