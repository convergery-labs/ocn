    a filing judged while the cache was stale keeps that verdict
    permanently, and nothing revisits it when the cache catches up.
    Ordering them in one process is what makes that impossible.

    Cheap enough to do every pass - measured at ~5 seconds over the
    9,176 articles currently stored, writing 83 series. The expensive
    half is the upstream revenue re-fetch (~90s, one request per
