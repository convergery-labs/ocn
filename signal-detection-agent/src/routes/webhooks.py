    care about any other domain. The existing 05:00 UTC schedule
    (infra/modules/ecs_cluster/services.tf, signal_detection_agent_

    webhook's delivery is fire-and-forget on news-retrieval's side (no

    delivery (this service briefly down/redeploying) still gets picked up
    a few hours later by the schedule rather than silently never running.
    Running the pipeline twice in one day is harmless - every stage's
    worklist query only selects rows the previous stage hasn't processed
    yet, so a second run that finds nothing new to do is a fast no-op.
