"""Stage D: free quality grading for geopolitical_signal rows Stage C has
already tagged (signal_detection='signal').

No model call anywhere in this module - every check is a deterministic
lookup, same free-checks philosophy as Stage A. Stage D answers a
different question than Stage C: Stage C says "who is this relevant to",
Stage D says "how much should a reader trust this specific item" - the
grade this produces is what would ultimately decide ordering in a digest
(TOP items first), not whether an item is included at all.

Three independent checks, each true/false:
  - corroborated: at least one other outlet (news-retrieval's
    metadata.also_reported_by on the source article) is itself a
    wire/paper-of-record on Stage A's own domain allowlist - not just any
    also_reported_by entry, since real data shows that field can be
    entirely local TV affiliates re-syndicating the same AP wire copy
    (confirmed live: article 16514 had 25 also_reported_by entries, all
    ABC/NBC local affiliates carrying one AP story - none of that is
    independent corroboration). The allowlisted subset that actually
    made this true is stored as corroborating_domains, alongside the
    boolean - previously read-then-discarded, so a caller could see
    THAT a story was corroborated but never WHICH outlets did it.
  - primary_source: the article's own domain is on Stage A's allowlist.
    Expected to be true for nearly every row reaching Stage D, since
    Stage A already only lets allowlisted-domain articles through in the
    first place - this check exists for completeness/documentation, not
    because it meaningfully differentiates rows in practice.
  - specific: the headline itself contains a digit (a concrete number -
    percentage, dollar amount, count, etc), OR Stage C's Layer 1 found a
    direct company-name match in the headline (impacted_companies_direct
    non-empty). Either is evidence the story is about something concrete
    rather than a vague, unquantified claim.

Grade: TOP (all 3 true), STRONG (exactly 2 true), STANDARD (0 or 1 true).

    Deliberately filtered, not the raw also_reported_by list verbatim:
    confirmed live that field can be entirely local TV affiliates
    re-syndicating one AP wire copy (article 16514 had 25 also_reported_by
    entries, all ABC/NBC local affiliates carrying one AP story - none of

    a name like "corroborating_domains" would make it look like real
    corroboration when it's actually syndication noise - the same problem
    this filter exists to avoid in the boolean, so the stored list mirrors
    the boolean's own standard exactly rather than being a separate, more
    permissive view of the same field.

    news-retrieval now writes also_reported_by as a domain derived from
    the duplicate article's own url (pipeline.py's
    _extract_domain_for_also_reported_by), same normalization as this
    function's "www." stripping - so a fresh entry is already comparable
    as-is. Confirmed live this was NOT always true: this function
    originally compared against article["source"] display names ("PBS",
    "Bloomberg Law News", "ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and
    Videos") that news-retrieval had been storing directly, which never
    matched ALLOWED_DOMAINS and made corroborated structurally
    unreachable. The "www." stripping here stays anyway as a defensive
    no-op against any older rows still holding a pre-fix display-name
    value (those will simply still not match, same as before - this
    function does not retroactively reclassify already-graded rows).
