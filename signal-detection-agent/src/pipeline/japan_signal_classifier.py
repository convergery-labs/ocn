"""Deterministic + habit-aware classification for japan_market_signal
items (news-retrieval's japan_market_signal domain: IRBANK forecast
revisions, buybacks, Kabutan/EDINET filings, SEAJ billings, press).

Follows the same design as korea_signal_classifier.py/
taiwan_signal_classifier.py: news-retrieval stays fetch/dedup-only - no
source_type computes a signal or translates text there. Arithmetic/lookup
rules live here; a real LLM call is reserved for the press layer (J7)
only, per the Japan Signals spec's own explicit design intent ("Five of
the seven signal types are arithmetic or a lookup. A model is used only
to judge whether a news headline states a fact or an opinion").

J1 (forecast revision) status here: IMPLEMENTED - classify_forecast_
revision(), the module's first signal type built. See that function's own
docstring for the full habit-computation design and the real data-quality
findings (from a live 20-company/5-year backfill against news-retrieval's
test DB, 2026-09-28) that shaped it:

  - Not every irbank_financials row is a genuine forward-looking revision.
    ~21% of the real 154-row sample were pure actuals-vs-forecast VARIANCE
    notices (title contains 差異, no accompanying 修正) with no "previous"
    figure to compare against at all - these carry no habit-relevant
    signal and are excluded from both the habit computation AND from
    being classified as a revision themselves (they are Japan Signals
    spec Section 5's J2 "results against forecast" material instead, not
    yet built here).
  - The spec's own Section 7.1 worked example (Advantest "raises 2x/yr",
    illustrative ~8-12% typical size) does NOT match Advantest's real
    filed history over the confirmed live window: real data shows ~3
    revisions/year with a real median absolute change near 30% - the
    spec's numbers are illustrative scaffolding, not literally sourced
    from Advantest's actual filings, so this module's own habit baseline
    is computed from each company's REAL stored history, never from the
    spec's own worked numbers.
  - Renesas Electronics (6723) reports quarterly range-based guidance in
    Non-GAAP margin PERCENTAGES (revenue/gross-margin%/operating-margin%),
    with no absolute yen operating-profit figure in any real filing
    checked - structurally incompatible with every other company's
    absolute-yen full-year-revision model, not a label variant to map
    around. Deliberately excluded from classify_forecast_revision
    entirely (see _JAPAN_OPERATING_PROFIT_EXCLUDED_CODES) rather than
    silently misreading a margin percentage as a yen amount.
  - The operating-profit line-item key varies across real filers -
    confirmed live: "営業利益" (the common case) and "営業利益（△損失）"
    (Kioxia's own label, "Operating Profit (or Loss)") are the same
    concept under two different literal keys - both are checked, not just
    the first.

J2 (results against forecast), J3 (missing revision), J4 (industry
equipment sales), and J5+J6 (capacity commitment / ownership and capital
policy - one combined function, classify_capacity_and_ownership, since
the spec's own Section 6.5 is one shared rule block for both) status:
IMPLEMENTED - classify_results_against_forecast(),
classify_missing_revision(), classify_industry_equipment_sales(),
classify_capacity_and_ownership(). See each function's own docstring for
its design and real-data findings - classify_capacity_and_ownership's own
docstring documents a real finding worth calling out here too: the
spec's literal "investment >= 10% of total assets" clause never fires on
real data (largest real case checked: 9.2%), so the 14-day
same-company-co-occurrence clause is the one that actually promotes real
J5 items to Signal in practice - confirmed live, not assumed.

J7 (press) status: IMPLEMENTED - classify_press(). See that function's
own docstring for its design and real-data findings, most importantly:
news-retrieval's own jp_press source has exactly TWO real sub-sources
wired (Jiji Press, Newswitch - see news-retrieval's CLAUDE.md for why
Nikkei itself, Reuters Japan and Kyodo News English were all checked and
found unusable), both already first-tier by this module's own tiering
(no second-tier source exists in this pipeline at all, unlike Korea's
mixed trusted-publication list) - and confirmed live 2026-09-29 this is a
genuinely thin real feed (1 real Newswitch article, 0 real Jiji articles,
in the current test window), matched by the spec's own Section 8's
observation that a market like this produces "few but heavy" signals.
All seven (J1-J7) are wired into classify_japan_signal_batch(), the
single entry point controllers/run.py calls.

        false 0.0, left None so callers can tell "no real spread data"
        from "this company's revisions genuinely never vary").

      typical_months: up to 3 calendar months (1-12) this company's real
        revisions most commonly land in - the 4th stored number the user
        explicitly asked for ("what point in the year does it usually
        happen"). A SET of months, not one, since a real filer revises at

# company/5-year audited sample, 154 real revisions): NOT ONE real
# reason text matches this case - every real reason found cites a genuine
# business driver (AI/semiconductor demand, segment performance, cost
# items, impairments), and several ALSO mention 為替/円安/円高 (currency)
# as one contributing factor among others, never as the sole cause.
#
# An earlier version of this function inferred "currency-only" from the
# ABSENCE of a small fixed whitelist of business-driver keywords (需要/
# 受注/生産/etc.) - confirmed live this produces real false positives: a
# genuine SUMCO reason citing lower-than-expected depreciation cost
# ("減価償却費を含むコストの発生が前回公表時の予想を下回った") and a
# genuine Resonac reason citing real segment demand ("半導体・電子材料
# セグメントにおいて需要が引き続き好調に推移") were both misclassified as
# NOISE purely because they also mentioned 為替 and didn't happen to use
# one of the whitelisted words - the same "keep discovering one more
# real-vocabulary variant" failure mode already hit and fixed twice for
# the reason-text boilerplate trim (see _IRBANK_REASON_BOILERPLATE_RE's
# own module-level comment in news-retrieval's pipeline.py).
#
# Rewritten to require POSITIVE, explicit evidence instead of inferring
# from absence: the reason must contain an explicit "solely due to
# currency" / "the underlying business is unaffected" phrasing pattern -
# a genuine business-driver-absent case would say something like "為替
# の影響のみにより" (due to currency effects ONLY) or "事業の状況に変化は
# ありません" (no change in business conditions) - not just happen to
# omit a whitelisted word. Since no real filing has ever used this
# phrasing in the audited sample, this rule is expected to correctly
# never fire against real data today, which is the honest, safe default
# given the false-positive risk just confirmed - it exists so a real
# future filing using this exact framing is still caught, rather than
# guessing at inclusion/exclusion word lists that keep needing new
# entries.

    spec Section 6.1 - J1, "the best single item in this market" (spec

    Only touches articles whose metadata.source_category == "jp_forecast"
    and that pass _is_genuine_revision (see that function's own docstring
    for why ~21% of real rows are pure variance notices, excluded here
    entirely - they contribute nothing to this signal type and are not
    classified as anything by this function).

    ``stored_habits``: {code: habit_dict}, normally
    models.japan_company_habits.get_all_habits()'s own return value - the
    PRE-COMPUTED per-company habit (revisions/year, typical size,
    direction, typical months), refreshed periodically by
    refresh_japan_habits() from the company's full stored history, not
    recomputed from THIS batch's own (possibly much smaller/more recent)
    articles - explicit user instruction 2026-09-28: "save those against
    each company... then when a new revision comes in, compare it to that
    company's own four numbers instead of a fixed threshold." A habit
    computed from only the few revisions in one classification batch
    would silently drift from - and eventually contradict - the company's
    own REAL 5-year pattern (e.g. a batch containing only this company's 2
    most recent revisions could never detect a 3-revisions/year real habit
    at all). Falls back to computing the habit from ``articles`` alone
    (the pre-refresh-table behavior) ONLY when no stored habit exists yet
    for a given code (e.g. before refresh_japan_habits has ever run) -
    this keeps the function safely callable standalone/in tests without
    requiring the DB-backed cache to exist first, while production callers
    (controllers/run.py) always pass the real stored_habits.

    Processes each company's own revisions together (grouped by
    metadata.code, sorted oldest-first) since Section 6.1's reversal rule
    is inherently relational - a same-fiscal-year reversal check against
    the immediately preceding revision - not evaluable from a single
    article in isolation the way Korea's own classify_supply_contract/
    classify_capacity_commitment rules are.

    Japan Signals spec Section 6.1 rules, applied in this exact order
    (first match wins, matching the spec's own "applied in order" table):
      1. NOISE - currency/accounting-only change, business unchanged.
         See _is_currency_or_accounting_only's own docstring: no real
         trigger confirmed yet.
      2. SIGNAL - reverses the direction of an earlier revision in the
         SAME fiscal year (a company that raised earlier this fiscal year
         now cuts, or vice versa).
      3. SIGNAL - moves between forecasting a profit and forecasting a
         loss (previous and revised operating profit have different
         signs, or previous == 0 crossing into a negative revised value).
      4. SIGNAL - this company's own habit shows fewer than one revision
         a year on average (rarely revises) and it has revised. Only
         evaluated when the habit is trusted (see
         _MIN_REVISIONS_FOR_TRUSTED_HABIT) - an untrusted low sample count
         cannot yet distinguish "genuinely rare" from "not enough history
         collected yet".
      5. SIGNAL - the revision is more than twice this company's own
         typical (median) revision size. Only evaluated when the habit is
         trusted, same reasoning as rule 4.
      6. SIGNAL - operating profit forecast changes by 20% or more. For an
         UNTRUSTED-habit company this alone is sufficient (the spec's own
         explicit habit-independent backstop - no trusted habit at all
         needed). For a TRUSTED-habit company, the move must ALSO exceed
         median + _ABSOLUTE_SIGNAL_MAD_MULTIPLE * MAD (median absolute
         deviation, this company's own real spread - see that constant's
         own comment for the full statistical testing behind this bar,
         and why a bare ">" against the median, or an earlier flat
         multiplier of it, both let routine above-average activity for
         volatile companies flood this rule with false positives).
      7. WEAK - anything else (a routine revision from a company that
         revises routinely, within its own normal range).

    Returns a list of {"article", "result"} dicts, same shape every other
    classify_* function in this codebase returns - result["source_id"] is
    the filing's own synthetic irbank-financials:// URL (already globally
    unique per filing, set by news-retrieval), so the caller's existing
    dedup-before-insert pattern works unchanged.

    finding). Same Signal/Weak/Noise philosophy, same "measure against
    this company's own real pattern, not a company-blind constant"
    design principle as every other rule in this module - just measuring
    a different real quantity (points of margin gap vs. last year's own
    actual, since that is the only real comparable pair this company's
    filings ever provide, not a change from an earlier stated forecast).

    ``stored_habits``: the SAME {code: habit_dict} lookup classify_
    forecast_revision reads (models.japan_company_habits.get_all_habits())
    - not a separate table/parameter. A margin-based company's row in
    that same table stores its typical gap (points) in the existing
    typical_size_pct column - a genuine, deliberate reuse, not a type
    mismatch: that column's real role in this table has always been "this
    company's typical revision-size measure," and nothing about it is
    yen-percent-specific at the storage layer - only classify_forecast_
    revision's own interpretation of it is. revisions_per_year/
    typical_direction/typical_month_1-3 simply stay NULL for this
    company's row, since no rule in this function reads them (this
    function's own simpler 2-rule chain, see below, needs only a typical
    gap size and a trust flag - the same two fields every other habit-
    based rule in this module already needs). Avoids a second new DB
    table/refresh path for what is, underneath, the exact same real
    concept (a per-company typical-deviation-size cache) computed a
    different way for the one company that needs it computed differently.
    Falls back to computing inline from ``articles`` alone when no stored
    habit exists yet for a code, same fallback contract as classify_
    forecast_revision.

    Rule (deliberately simpler than classify_forecast_revision's 6-rule
    chain - the reversal/profit-loss-swing/rare-reviser rules all depend
    on a same-fiscal-year comparison to an immediately preceding
    revision, which this company's own data cannot support; only the
    two rules that make sense for a fixed-reference-point gap are kept):
      SIGNAL - this filing's gap (new margin vs. last year's actual for
               the same period) is more than this company's own typical
               gap, once trusted (median-based, same _TYPICAL_SIZE_
               MULTIPLE_THRESHOLD-equivalent reasoning as J1's own 2x
               rule - but here the multiplier is folded into a single
               points-based floor, see below).
      SIGNAL - the gap is at least 10.0 points, regardless of habit - the
               margin-equivalent of _ABSOLUTE_SIGNAL_THRESHOLD_PCT's own
               fixed floor, chosen from this company's own real data: the
               real median absolute gap across its full stored history is
               4.9 points, so a floor of double that (10.0) marks a real
               gap large enough to be unusual by this company's own
               long-run standard, not an arbitrary round number - same
               "validate against real data, don't just assert a number"
               standard J1's own 20% floor was held to.
      WEAK   - anything else with a real, computable gap.

    Untrusted (fewer than 3 real samples): falls back to the flat 10.0-

# Redefined from the spec's own literal wording after confirming live
# 2026-09-29 against the real 20-company/5-year dataset: a GENUINE
# revision (a real change to an already-existing forecast number) does
# NOT recur on a predictable per-company calendar - confirmed live no
# company/month combination has genuine revisions (figures[0]["_kind"] ==
# "revision" AND a non-null previous value) in 3+ distinct years anywhere
# in the dataset, so "this company normally revises in month X" has no
# real support to check "did it happen again this year" against.
#
# What DOES recur reliably is the FIRST-TIME quarterly/half-year/full-year
# FORECAST ANNOUNCEMENT (figures[0]["_kind"] == "revision" with a NULL
# previous value - no revision, a fresh guidance issuance) - confirmed
# live: Disco's real history shows an announcement in every one of its 19
# real quarterly slots from 2021-10 through 2026-04 with zero gaps, and
# critically, its July 2026 slot (confirmed overdue by 160+ real days as
# of 2026-09-29, checked against BOTH the stored backfill AND IRBANK's own
# live page directly - not a backfill-lag artifact) is a real, live,
# currently-ongoing missing case - the exact "expected thing not
# happening" the spec's own Section 4.1 describes, just for the
# announcement mechanism rather than the revision mechanism specifically.
# This module tracks announcement slots, not literal "revisions", as the
# thing whose absence is detected - the spec's own underlying intent (spot
# an expected filing that didn't show up) is served correctly this way;
# its literal wording is not, given what 5 years of real data actually
# supports.
#
# A company's real slot calendar is NOT a generic "every 3 months"
# template - confirmed live Disco's own slots are asymmetric by period
# type (January = full-year 当期 guidance for the ending year, April = Q1
# 四半期, July = half-year 中間, October = Q3 四半期) - learned per company
# from its own real historical months, never assumed from a fixed
# template.
_MIN_YEARS_FOR_TRUSTED_SLOT_CALENDAR = 3

# confirmed real per-company span), so the ratio is computed against
# however many years of real history exist for THIS slot, not hardcoded
# to a literal /5.

# instant the calendar date passes - real filing dates vary by a few days

# positive for Tokyo Electron (no forecast-revision filing since 2024-08,
# but confirmed live on IRBANK's own site to have filed disclosures
# continuously through 2026-08 - the company simply had no need to revise
# its forecast in that window, which is normal, not silence) and the same
# risk was confirmed to apply to Screen Holdings. "No forecast revision"
# and "the company has gone quiet" are not the same fact, and jp_forecast
# alone cannot tell them apart - a reliable version of this check would
# need to cross-reference a company's OTHER disclosure types (e.g. EDINET

    Signals spec Section 6.3 ("the expected thing not happening") - J3.

    See this module's own comment above for the real-data-driven
    redefinition (tracks first-time announcement slots, not literal
    revisions) and every edge case this function accounts for:

      - Not enough years of history: a slot needs
        _MIN_YEARS_FOR_TRUSTED_SLOT_CALENDAR real prior occurrences before
        "missing" means anything - a company with only 1-2 years of
        stored history has no established pattern to judge an absence
        against (same "not enough data yet" principle as every other
        habit-based rule in this module).
      - The slot's window hasn't passed yet: only a slot whose usual month
        (plus _SLOT_OVERDUE_GRACE_DAYS grace for normal date jitter) has
        already passed this fiscal year, with nothing filed, counts as
        missing - a slot due next month is not evidence of anything yet.
      - Normal date jitter: a company's real filing date for the "same"
        slot varies by some days year to year - the grace window absorbs
        this rather than flagging the day after the single earliest
        historical date.
      - Multiple filings in one slot: a real slot can have more than one
        announcement in the same month (confirmed live: Disco filed twice
        in July 2025) - _build_slot_calendar records every occurrence, not
        just one, so this doesn't distort the hit-count.

    ``as_of``: the "today" this function judges overdue-ness against -
    defaults to real UTC now. Exposed as a parameter (not hardcoded to
    datetime.now()) so this function is deterministically testable against
    a fixed point in time, not whatever day it happens to run.

    Japan Signals spec Section 6.3 rule (ratio-based - see
    _SIGNAL_HIT_RATIO/_WEAK_HIT_RATIO's own comment on why a ratio, not a
    literal "4 of 5"/"3 of 5", is used against real variable-depth data):
      SIGNAL - this slot's real historical hit ratio is >= 80% (the
               spec's own "4 of the last 5 years" threshold) and the slot
               is now overdue with nothing filed.
      WEAK   - hit ratio is >= 60% but < 80% (the spec's own "3 of the
               last 5 years", a weaker but still real pattern) and overdue.
      (no result) - hit ratio below 60% (spec: "no consistent pattern
               exists"), OR the slot isn't overdue yet, OR not enough
               years of history exist to compute a ratio at all. Per the
               spec's own words ("Handle this carefully... present it as
               an observation... never let it lead the summary"), an
               absence this function can't confidently characterize
               produces NO row, not a fabricated WEAK - unlike J1/J2,
               which always produce a WEAK fallback for a real filing
               that exists but is merely unremarkable, there is no real
               filing here to fall back to describing.

    Deliberately does NOT attempt to detect a company "going quiet"
    entirely (Japan Signals spec Step 0's own delisting/take-private
    concern) - see this module's own comment above _SLOT_OVERDUE_GRACE_DAYS
    for why that check was built, found unreliable against real data
    (a confirmed Tokyo Electron false positive), and removed rather than
    shipped as a confidently-labeled result.

# Japan Signals spec Section 10.3's own WATCHING section ("companies
# diverging from their own pattern that have not announced anything") -
# this was a real, documented gap (see the date-window note in
# former top-docstring note) until this function: no existing classify_*
# function scanned a company's CURRENT standing against its own habit
# with no new filing to trigger it. classify_missing_revision (J3) is the
# closest real precedent for scanning-without-a-filing, but it answers a
# different question ("did an EXPECTED FILING fail to arrive in its usual
# calendar slot") - this function answers "has more real time passed
# since this company's last genuine revision than its own established
# cadence would predict", using only data already computed and stored:
# the real dates of past genuine revisions (already fetched/stored by
# news-retrieval, filtered the same way compute_forecast_habit's own
# caller filters them) and revisions_per_year from japan_company_habits
# (already computed by refresh-japan-habits). No new data source, no new
# LLM call - pure date arithmetic against real stored history, same
# "arithmetic, not judgment" design every other rule in this module uses.
#
# Deliberately NOT the same thing as the removed "company has gone quiet
# entirely" check documented above (see the comment above
# _SLOT_OVERDUE_GRACE_DAYS) - that check inferred "may be delisting" from
# silence alone and produced a confirmed live false positive (Tokyo
# Electron, Screen Holdings: no forecast revision in a long stretch
# because nothing warranted one, not because the company had gone quiet).
# This function makes a narrower, more defensible claim: not "something
# is wrong", only "this specific company's real elapsed silence is now
# longer, relative to ITS OWN established cadence, than is typical for
# it" - an observation about pace, stated as a fact with the real numbers
# attached, never a prediction of what happens next (matching the spec's
# own explicit instruction: "Do not predict whether a revision will
# come"). For exactly that reason this function only ever emits WEAK
# ("weak_signal"), never SIGNAL - "overdue relative to habit" is
# real and worth surfacing, but it is not itself a confirmed event the
# way an actual filed revision is.
_STALE_SIGNAL_RATIO = 2.0  # elapsed / typical_gap_days at or above this: weak_signal
# WATCHING reports a company diverging from its own pattern, which
# presumes the pattern still describes the company. Past some age the
# habit's own evidence is too old to carry that claim, and the honest
# reading becomes "this baseline is out of date" rather than "this
# company is overdue".
#
# The test is the age of the habit's most recent observation, not how
# many multiples of the cadence have elapsed. A ratio cannot separate the
# two real situations that produce a large value, because both a densely
# observed company that is genuinely late and a company whose cadence was
# measured from a brief cluster years ago present as the same number -
# confirmed against the stored universe, where Tokyo Electron (14
# revisions, most recent 2024-08) and Screen Holdings (3 revisions, most
# recent 2021-10) sit at a comparable 4.3x and 4.9x while meaning
# entirely different things.
#
# 3 years is the boundary because _MIN_FISCAL_YEAR_SPAN_FOR_TRUSTED_HABIT
# already requires a habit to span at least 3 fiscal years before it is
# trusted at all. A company silent for longer than the minimum span used
# to establish a pattern has now been silent longer than the evidence the
# pattern rests on, so the cadence no longer describes current behaviour.
# Using the same span for both keeps one definition of how much history
# makes a pattern real, rather than introducing a second, unrelated one.
_HABIT_EVIDENCE_STALE_DAYS = 365 * _MIN_FISCAL_YEAR_SPAN_FOR_TRUSTED_HABIT
# Below _STALE_SIGNAL_RATIO's own threshold, normal per-company jitter
# (a company whose typical cadence is "twice a year" does not revise
# every exactly-182-days) must not itself be misread as drift - confirmed
# live reasoning from compute_forecast_habit's own docstring: even a
# reliable habit's real spacing varies year to year. 2x the company's own
# typical gap is a deliberately conservative bar - meaningfully overdue by
# the company's own measure, not merely "a bit longer than usual".

    tracked company whose real elapsed time since its last genuine
    forecast revision now exceeds its own established cadence, with
    nothing new filed to explain the gap. See this module's own comment
    above for the full design rationale and why this is answers a
    different question from classify_missing_revision (J3).

    ``articles``: the same full pooled jp_forecast batch every other
    forecast-revision rule in this module reads from - this function
    finds each tracked company's own most recent genuine revision date
    directly from real article history, not from a stored "last seen"
    column (none exists - see japan_company_habits.py's own schema,
    which stores only aggregate stats, never a last-revision date). This
    is exactly why the caller (controllers.run.refresh_japan_habits) MUST
    pass the same full wide-history pool it already assembles for
    compute_all_japan_habits, not a narrower window: passing a narrower
    ``articles`` window than a company's TRUE last real revision would
    make that revision invisible here, either wrongly treating a company
    with a real recent revision (just outside the passed window) as
    having none at all (silently skipped, see below) or, worse, finding
    an OLDER real revision still inside the window and wrongly reporting
    it as the company's most recent one - overstating elapsed_days. Not
    a risk today (refresh-japan-habits's own default from_date is the
    full 10-year backfill window), but a real constraint on how this
    function may ever be called, stated here rather than left implicit.
    ``stored_habits``: {code: habit_dict} from japan_company_habits (see
    classify_forecast_revision's own docstring) - this function reads
    each company's own real revisions_per_year and is_trusted.
    ``as_of``: the real "today" this function judges elapsed time
    against - defaults to real UTC now, exposed as a parameter for the
    same deterministic-testing reason classify_missing_revision's own
    ``as_of`` parameter is.

    Only ever produces weak_signal rows (see _STALE_SIGNAL_RATIO's own
    comment on why never a full signal), and only for a company whose
    habit is_trusted (same standard J1 itself requires before comparing
    anything against a company's habit - an untrusted, sparse habit's own
    revisions_per_year is not a reliable cadence to measure lateness
    against). A company with NO real revision anywhere in ``articles`` at
    all is skipped entirely (nothing to measure elapsed time from) rather
    than treated as maximally overdue - a real gap in what news-retrieval
    has fetched/stored is a data-completeness question, not evidence this
    company itself is behaving unusually.

    result["article"] is None for every row here, same as J3 - there is
    no real article behind an absence, described the same way J3's own
    result shape already establishes for that case.

#
#   大量保有報告書 - an INITIAL report: a holder newly crossing 5%, which
#       is the event the spec's own rule describes.
#   変更報告書     - a CHANGE report: an existing holder adjusting a
#       position already disclosed. Filed on any 1%+ move, so it
#       describes a position that crossed 5% at some earlier point,
#       possibly years earlier.
#
#   特例対象株券等 - the relaxed periodic-filing regime available to
#       passive institutional holders (asset managers, brokers, trust
#       banks). These filings report custody and index positions on a
#       schedule rather than a control decision taken on a date.
#
# Stake size does not substitute for either: the largest real holding in
# the stored set is a legacy position reported on a change report, while
# a genuine new crossing sits near the statutory floor. A threshold on
# the percentage promotes the former and demotes the latter.
#
# Of the two, the FILING REGIME is the stronger signal, because it says
# something about the holder's intent that neither the report type nor
# the stake does. The passive regime is only available to a holder that
# has declared it is not seeking control - so an active-basis filing is
# an ordinary company or fund taking a deliberate position, while a
# passive one is an index or custody position moving with its mandate.
# Report type then separates a new position from a change to an existing
# one within each of those.

    Real-data findings that shaped this function (confirmed live
    2026-09-29 against news-retrieval's test DB, see PR history for the
    exact figures):
      - The spec's own literal "investment >= 10% of total assets" clause
        NEVER fires on real data: all 15 real jp_capex articles carrying
        an extractable investment figure, checked against each company's
        real total assets, came in well under 10% (largest: Shin-Etsu's
        real ~JPY530bn US expansion at 9.2%). This is a genuine finding
        about the market, not a bug - large Japanese industrials'
        balance sheets are simply big relative to any single plant
        announcement - so the clause is kept exactly as spec'd (never
        loosened to force it to fire) and the 14-day co-occurrence clause
        is expected to be the one that actually promotes real J5 items to
        Signal in practice, same as J1's currency-only-Noise rule and
        J3's missing-slot rule are kept exactly as spec'd despite rarely
        firing on real data.
      - jp_ownership's own docTypeCode 350 ("large shareholding report")
        is BY LEGAL DEFINITION only filed once a holder's stake crosses
        5% - every real row already IS a 5%-crossing event, so no
        before/after delta computation is needed or possible (there is
        no "below 5%" row to compare against - the filing simply does not
        exist below that threshold). Every real jp_ownership article is
        therefore SIGNAL under this rule, unconditionally.
      - jp_buyback is a MONTHLY RUNNING-STATUS feed, not a one-time
        announcement (confirmed live: Advantest has 28 real status rows
        across 4 distinct board-resolution programs since 2020, e.g.
        "+124万株" one month, "+84万株" the next, against the SAME
        program's fixed cap). The spec's own wording is "a buyback... is
        ANNOUNCED" - matched here to the FIRST status row seen for a
        given program_resolution (a real, distinct board-resolution date
        embedded in that field), not to every monthly progress update,

HIGH means the headline states a specific, checkable fact:

- a change to a company forecast
- a named customer, partner, supplier or contract
- an order, a capacity change or an investment decision
- a government or regulatory action naming the company

WEAK means anything else:
- analyst opinion, ratings or price targets
- outlook or sentiment with no figure
- the company mentioned in passing in a market round-up
- a story mainly about a different company

Who is speaking matters. A fact stated by the company, the
exchange or a regulator is HIGH. The same fact predicted by an
analyst is WEAK.

A Nikkei report of something the company has not yet confirmed
is HIGH, but set unconfirmed to true. The Nikkei reports
accurately ahead of formal disclosure often enough that
downgrading it loses real information.

    three free filters, then one model call for whatever survives.

    Filter 1 (trusted publication): drop unless the article's own domain
    is in _JAPAN_PRESS_TRUSTED_PUBLICATIONS. In practice this never drops
    anything real today, since news-retrieval's own jp_press fetcher only
    ever wires Jiji/Newswitch in the first place (see that source's own
    CLAUDE.md entry) - kept as an explicit, real gate anyway (same
    reasoning _japan_press_company_name_in_headline's own docstring gives
    for Filter 2), not skipped just because it currently never fires.

    Filter 2 (company name in headline): see
    _japan_press_company_name_in_headline's own docstring.

    Filter 3 (repeat story, spec's own "already seen"): counts distinct
    publications carrying this story via metadata.also_reported_by, same
    field/convention Korea's own _publications_carrying_story reads.
    CONFIRMED LIVE 2026-09-29 this is currently always 1 for every real
    jp_press row: japan_market_signal is NOT in news-retrieval's own
    _TITLE_DEDUP_DOMAINS (unlike korea_market_signal), so also_reported_by
    is never populated for this domain - a real, documented gap (adding
    japan_market_signal to that set is a news-retrieval change, out of
    scope for this classifier). Computed and sent anyway (not hardcoded
    to 1) so the wiring is correct and starts reflecting real repeat
    coverage the moment that gap is closed, without this function needing
    a second change then.

    Model: one HIGH/WEAK(+unconfirmed) call (spec 10.1) on whatever
    survives all three filters.

    Rule (spec Section 6.6's own table):
      SIGNAL (unconfirmed=True):  model says HIGH unconfirmed=true AND
                                  the publication is Jiji (this

                                  even though unconfirmed - the spec's
                                  own explicit instruction.
      SIGNAL:                     model says HIGH (not marked
                                  unconfirmed, or unconfirmed from a

                                  the model - not returned as a
                                  classified result at all (mirrors

                                  articles: a dropped-by-filter article
                                  was never a candidate).

    Model-input wiring (spec Section 10.2's field layout) - company/code/
    source/original/published/company_revision_habit/progress_vs_usual
    are all sent to the model now (see _classify_japan_press_relevance's
    own docstring for why "original" carries the real Japanese title and
    no separate English "headline" field is sent - no real English
    headline exists yet at this point in the pipeline).
    company_revision_habit is read from ``stored_habits`` (the SAME real
    J1 cache classify_forecast_revision already receives - see
    classify_japan_signal_batch, which now threads it into this function
    too) and formatted via _format_company_revision_habit. May be
    None/omitted (falls back to an empty dict, same as J1's own
    stored_habits fallback) - every real jp_press article then simply
    sends "not established" when no habit is found for its company,
    rather than this function failing or fabricating a plausible-looking
    value.

    progress_vs_usual describes how a company's LATEST real filed result
    compares to its own usual pace (progress_pct - typical_progress_pct),
    same real gap classify_results_against_forecast (J2) already computes
    per-filing - but a jp_press headline is not itself a filing, so it has
    no progress reading of its own. Re-read against the spec's own
    Section 10.3 framing ("items arrive already classified... carries...
    the company's revision habit... use them exactly as given"),
    progress_vs_usual is COMPANY-level context attached to any item about
    that company, same as company_revision_habit already is - not
    something that must be derived from the specific item's own content.
    Resolved via ``latest_progress_by_code`` ({code: {progress_pct,
    typical_progress_pct, published}}), built by
    classify_japan_signal_batch from this SAME batch's own real J2
    results before calling classify_press (see that function's own
    comment on how "most recent" is picked deterministically when a
    company has more than one real J2 result in the batch). This is a
    real, stored-as-of-last-filing snapshot - the same "as of last known
    data" spirit company_revision_habit already has (that field is also
    only as fresh as japan_company_habits' last refresh, not computed
    live from the press headline either) - not a live computation from
    the press article's own text, and not a fabricated/guessed number
    when no real J2 result exists for this company in the batch (falls
    back to "not established", same principle as company_revision_habit's
    own missing-habit case).

    The remaining three of Section 10.2's "already worked out" fields
    (publications_carrying_this, english_coverage_found, price_move_today)
    stay correctly unsent here - publications_carrying_this is already
    computed elsewhere in this function but is a metadata field on the
    RESULT, not a model input per spec 10.2 (rereading 10.2's own layout:
    it lists it as an input too, but this function's own Filter 3 already
    established it is always 1 today, real but uninformative - no real
    basis is skipped by leaving it as a stored result field only, not a
    second copy sent to the model); english_coverage_found and
    price_move_today remain Section 10.3 SUMMARY WRITER inputs this
    function has no real basis for at all (no English-coverage check or
    market price feed reaches this classifier).

semiconductor, equipment, materials and electronics companies as
HIGH, WEAK or ROUTINE.

HIGH means the filing changes what the company owns, controls or
is committing capital to:
- an acquisition, merger, spin-off, divestiture or joint venture
- an investment in, or sale of, a stake in another company
- a plant, site or business being opened, closed or transferred
- a capital raise, bond issue or change to the share structure
- a change of control, or a tender offer

WEAK means a real decision that does not change the above:
- a change of representative director or senior management
- a dividend policy change
- an organisational or reporting-structure change
- a disclosure whose substance you cannot determine

ROUTINE means administrative filings that recur as a matter of
course:
- stock options, restricted stock, or treasury shares issued for
  employee or director compensation
- articles of incorporation, internal regulations, or similar
  filings
- a notice of a scheduled meeting, or its results
- a correction or re-filing of an earlier document

Judge the filing itself, not whether the company is important.
A compensation filing from a large company is still ROUTINE.
If unsure, answer WEAK.

Answer with the tier, then a slash, then the action the title names,
as a noun phrase taken from the title. Do not add detail the title
does not state.

Keep any qualifier the title gives that changes what the action
means - which business, which subsidiary, which tranche, whether it
is planned or completed. Drop only words that carry nothing:
"Announcement Concerning", "Notice Regarding", "Execution of".

"Execution of Follow-on Investment (Third Tranche) in OpenAI"
  -> follow-on investment in OpenAI, third tranche
"Completion of Execution of Partial Spin-off of Crasus Chemical

  -> completed partial spin-off of Crasus Chemical's petrochemical business
"Announcement Concerning Absorption-type Merger with a Wholly Owned
 Subsidiary and Closure of its Business Site"
  -> absorption-type merger with a wholly owned subsidiary, and closure

# `currentReportReason` is the FSA disclosure ordinance clause the

#
# This is why an extraordinary report needs no PDF fetch to be
# described: news-retrieval already stores the clause from
# documents.json (see its own comment on _EDINET_DOC_TYPE_
# EXTRAORDINARY). Before this map, every such row fell back to "a
# corporate disclosure whose effect is not established from the
# filing's own title" - true of the title, but the row carried the
# answer in a field nothing read.
#
# Keys are matched on the clause's numbered tail, since filings write
# the same clause with full-width and half-width digits
# interchangeably ("第2項第4号" / "第２項第４号").
# Only clauses CONFIRMED against a real stored filing are listed.
# An unlisted clause returns None and keeps the plain sentence, which
# is why a half-remembered entry is worse than a missing one: it
# labels a filing with the wrong event and nothing flags it. The first
# draft of this map carried five clauses written from memory of the
# ordinance, including "9号" sitting beside the real "9号の2" - close
# enough to look right and wrong in exactly the way a reader cannot
# check. Add a clause here when a filing citing it has been read.
# Japanese-only filing titles that are a standard document NAME rather
# than a description of an event. Asked to summarise one, the model
# returns the name verbatim, which puts untranslated Japanese on an

    The seven rules before this one each read a specific, numeric filing

    A corporate action has no such figure in its title: a spin-off, a
    merger or an investment in another company is material because of
    what it does, not because of a number it reports. So unlike J1-J6,
    there is nothing here to threshold, and unlike them this reads the
    filing's own words.

    Kabutan's own category field cannot stand in for that judgment:
    measured on the stored set it reads その他 ("other") on most rows,
    including a follow-on investment in OpenAI and a petrochemical
    spin-off. A keyword list over Japanese titles was the other option
    and was rejected - these filings are formulaic enough that a list
    would work on the examples in hand and silently miss the phrasings
    nobody thought of, which is the failure mode a fixed list always
    has.

    the deterministic work - pairing the bilingual copies, mapping the

    through; this module has no DB access itself, same boundary every
    other pipeline/*.py module in this service already follows.

    J1 and J2 read from the SAME jp_forecast articles but are mutually
    exclusive per article (an article's figures[0]["_kind"] is either
    "revision", in which case only J1 touches it, or
    "actual_vs_forecast", in which case only J2 does - see each
    function's own filtering) - passing the full pooled ``articles`` list
    to both is correct and not wasteful, matching how Korea's own
    classify_korea_signal_batch calls every classify_* function against
    the full batch regardless of which rows each one will actually touch.
    J4 reads from a disjoint jp_industry slice, J5/J6 (one combined
    function, classify_capacity_and_ownership) read from disjoint
    jp_capex/jp_ownership/jp_buyback slices, and J7 reads from a disjoint
    jp_press slice, of the same pooled ``articles`` list - all grouped
    with J1/J2 below since, like them, each of their results carries a
    real article (unlike J3 - see below). Passing jp_industry through
    translate_japan_articles is a safe no-op (no entry in
    _TRANSLATION_FIELDS - SEAJ's press release is already English).
    jp_ownership and jp_buyback both have real entries now, even though
    each one's own TITLE is structural/numeric (ticker, doc_id,
    docDescription label for jp_ownership; company/date/share-count for
    jp_buyback) - the genuine Japanese prose lives in specific METADATA
    fields instead (jp_ownership's filer_name; jp_buyback's
    program_resolution/program_limits/program_period - see
    _TRANSLATION_FIELDS's own comments on each for why, added after
    confirming live every real row of both had unreadable-to-
    non-Japanese-speakers text with no English equivalent anywhere else
    on the row); jp_capex and jp_press DO have entries (their titles are real Japanese
    prose, same as jp_forecast's), so this costs nothing extra to include
    and keeps one single translate/metadata-refresh pass for every result
    backed by a real article.

    J3 is genuinely different from J1/J2/J4/J5/J6/J7: its results
    describe an ABSENCE (no filing exists to point to), so
    result["article"] is a small synthetic dict (title + a real `as_of`
    published timestamp - see classify_missing_revision's own result-
    shape comment for why not None), never a real news-retrieval article
    dict - handled separately from the translate/metadata-refresh step
    below, which only makes sense for a result backed by a real article
    (J3's own metadata/reason are already final, in English, with no
    native-language field to translate).

    classify_stale_revision_pattern (the spec's own WATCHING section) is
    NOT called from here, unlike J3 - see that function's own docstring
    for why: it needs each company's real FULL revision history to find a
    genuine "last revision date", but this function is normally called
    with only a narrow recent window (classify-japan-signals defaults to
    a single day - see __main__.py). Wired instead into
    controllers.run.refresh_japan_habits, which already pools the full
    wide-history window this function needs and runs on the same
    occasional (e.g. monthly) cadence a stale-revision reading calls for.

    pooled batch of jp_forecast articles (normally that company's FULL

    CLI docstring for how the caller assembles this).

    Pure function (no DB access, same boundary as every other pipeline/
    *.py module here) - controllers/run.py's refresh_japan_habits() is
    responsible for pooling the articles (via news-retrieval's own
    list_completed_runs/get_run_articles, a wide date window) and writing
    this function's return value via models.japan_company_habits.

    Returns one dict per japan_ticker_universe() company (code, company,
    plus every compute_forecast_habit field) - including companies with
    ZERO genuine revisions in the pooled articles (habit fields None,
    sample_size 0, is_trusted False) rather than omitting them, so
    replace_habits's delete-then-insert always produces one row per
    tracked company, never a silently-missing row for a company that
    happens to have no revisions in this particular pool.

    _MARGIN_BASED_CODES companies (Renesas Electronics) are a real
    exception to the above: compute_margin_revision_habit runs instead of
    compute_forecast_habit for these, and its own typical_gap_pts value
    is stored in this same row's typical_size_pct slot - see
    classify_margin_forecast_revision's own docstring for why this reuses
    japan_company_habits rather than a second table. revisions_per_year/
    typical_direction/typical_months are left None for this company's
    row, since no rule reads them for a margin-based company.
