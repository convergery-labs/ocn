"""Deterministic classification for korea_market_signal items (DART
filings and Korea Customs export data read from news-retrieval).

Follows the same design as taiwan_signal_classifier.py: news-retrieval
stays fetch/dedup-only, uniformly across every domain - no source type
computes a signal or translates text there. Arithmetic/lookup rules live
here; a real LLM call is reserved for the news layer (S7) only, per the
Korea Signals spec's own design intent ("five of the seven signal types
are decided by arithmetic or by looking up a code").

Signal types and their status here:
  S1 export surprise      - REOPENED 2026-09-23 (was briefly marked
                             permanently out of scope - see below for why
                             that reversed) and IMPLEMENTED:
                             classify_export_surprise(). The two API-key
                             backfill paths (data.go.kr, Bank of Korea
                             ECOS) both genuinely require Korea's mobile-
                             carrier identity verification (PASS, run by
                             NICE) - confirmed live against both real
                             signup flows, no foreigner path exists for
                             either. BUT: news-retrieval's own Customs
                             board scraper turned out to already expose
                             full pagination on its title-search endpoint
                             (no login at all) reaching back through real
                             historical posts - a code limitation (only
                             ever reading page 1's first match), not a
                             source limitation. news-retrieval's
                             fetch_customs_export_backfill() (pipeline.py)
                             now walks that pagination for real historical
                             semiconductor figures. Honest remaining gap:
                             the board's own detail-page FORMAT changes
                             further back in its history (confirmed live:
                             March 2026 in the specific backfill run
                             checked) - posts older than that are stub
                             pages linking to an unopenable .hwpx/.pdf
                             attachment, so real backfillable depth is
                             ~7 months, not the full 2 years Section 5.1's
                             own build note asks for. This function's own
                             per-period-type precondition check (needs a
                             same-period-one-year-ago reading AND 12 prior
                             equivalent periods) means it correctly
                             produces ZERO real classifications today -
                             not a bug, an honest reflection of real data
                             not existing yet - and will start producing
                             real output as the existing 4-hourly poll's
                             own organic growth (plus this backfill's head
                             start) crosses that threshold over the
                             following months.

  S6 rumour adjudication   - IMPLEMENTED across three functions:

  S7 qualification news    - IMPLEMENTED: classify_qualification_news() +
                             translation via _TRANSLATION_FIELDS["qualification_news"].
                             Three free filters (trusted publication,

                             then one HIGH/WEAK model call (spec 8.1-8.3),
                             mirroring Taiwan's classify_gdelt_articles -
                             the one real LLM call in this module. Known
                             gap: model call doesn't yet receive
                             publications_carrying_this/english_coverage_found/
                             price_move_today as context (computed but not
                             sent - see the function's own docstring).
                             Section 5.8's two override rules (already-
                             moved price action, index-reweighting
                             suppression) aren't implemented anywhere -
                             checked live 2026-09-23, Alpha Vantage has no
                             real KRX quote for this universe (see the
                             note further down), a genuine data-source
                             gap rather than a code gap.

English-coverage comparison (spec Section 7 Step 5 / Section 6.4's
"English press" line): IMPLEMENTED via _attach_english_coverage(), called
at the end of classify_korea_signal_batch() against the full pooled
batch. Not yet live-verified end-to-end against a real English GDELT row
(KOREA_GDELT_ENGLISH_SOURCE has never actually landed a stored row yet -
GDELT's own rate limit has blocked every live fetch attempt this session,
left untouched per explicit instruction) - verified instead with a
synthetic row shaped exactly like a real one (ticker suffixed "-en",
matching seed.py's own construction) reproducing the spec's own Section
6.5 worked example (Hanmi Semiconductor, "English coverage appeared 6h
after the Korean") to confirm the join/delta arithmetic is correct. Needs
a real live check once GDELT's rate limit clears and a real
korea_market_signal_english row actually lands in storage.

Section 5.8 (the two rules that override everything above - "already
moved" price-action downgrade, index-reweighting suppression) - NOT
IMPLEMENTED ANYWHERE. Both need real-time KRX stock price data. Checked
live 2026-09-23: Alpha Vantage (the only market-data source already wired
into this codebase - see news-retrieval's poller.py) has no real KRX quote
for these companies - GLOBAL_QUOTE for 000660.KS/005930.KS returns an
empty object, and SYMBOL_SEARCH for "SK Hynix" surfaces only US OTC ADR
proxies (HXSCL, SKHY) and a Frankfurt GDR (HY9H.FRK), none of which track
real KRX price action (different market, different hours, different
liquidity - using one as a stand-in would produce a misleading "already
moved" signal, not a correct one). Same shape as the S1 blocker (a real
external data source is missing, not a code gap) - not pursued further per
explicit decision, pending a real KRX-quote source being found or added.

Orchestration: classify_korea_signal_batch() runs S2-S7 (S1 excluded, not
yet implemented) against one pooled batch and translates whatever
survived - the function controllers/run.py's run_korea_signal_classification
calls, same role as classify_taiwan_signal_batch for Taiwan.

Translation (Korea Signals spec Section 7 Step 8 / Section 2's "Plain
English, with the Korean original attached" want): reuses
taiwan_signal_classifier's _translate_one/_get_nested directly rather
than re-implementing the same raw HTTP-to-OpenAI-compatible-endpoint call
a second time - that machinery has no Taiwan-specific logic in it (it's a
generic "translate this string" helper), so importing it here is
deliberate reuse, not an accidental cross-domain dependency. Only
_TRANSLATION_FIELDS (which fields need translation, per source_category)
and translate_korea_articles() (the orchestration loop) are Korea's own -
same split Taiwan itself has between its generic helpers and its own
_TRANSLATION_FIELDS map/translate_taiwan_articles() loop.

# Korea Signals spec Section 5.3. TWO real, genuinely different DART form
# templates cover this signal type - confirmed live 2026-09-23 against 6

# Hanmi Semiconductor x2):
#
#   "신규시설투자등" (new facility investment) - 투자금액(원) / 자기자본(원)
#   / 자기자본대비(%) / 투자목적 / 투자기간 시작일·종료일. The percentage
#   here is against EQUITY (자기자본/capital), not total assets - a
#   materially different, larger-looking number than a %-of-total-assets
#   figure for the same investment (equity is always <= total assets).
#   4 of 6 real filings used this template (Simmtech 47.6%, SK Hynix
#   29.19%, SK Square 29.19% [see dedup note below], Daeduck 55.39%).
#
#   "유형자산취득결정" (tangible asset acquisition decision) -
#   취득가액(원) / 자산총액(원) / 자산총액대비(%) / 거래상대 / 취득목적.
#   This one genuinely does match the spec's literal wording ("percentage
#   of total assets") - Hanmi Semiconductor's two real examples (6.54%,
#   6.89%) both used this template.
#
# The spec's own rule text ("Amount as a percentage of total assets") is
# only exactly correct for the second template - stored as two distinct
# metadata fields (pct_of_equity / pct_of_total_assets) rather than
# force-unified into one "pct" field that would misrepresent which base a
# given filing's percentage is actually measured against.

# 연결재무제표기준영업(잠정)실적(공정공시) filings (Daeduck Electronics, DB

# separate label-value fields like S2/S3. After HTML stripping, one row

#   {qoq_transition_flag_or_dash} {yoy_qtr} {yoy_pct_or_dash}
#   {yoy_transition_flag_or_dash}
# in KRW millions (단위: 백만원 - stated once near the top of the table,
# not repeated per row). Two real quirks a naive percentage regex misses:
#   1. YoY%/QoQ% CAN exceed 999% and Korean number formatting still
#      thousands-commas it (confirmed live: Daeduck's real operating
#      profit YoY change was "3,666.0" - a genuine 3,666% swing off a
#      near-zero prior-year base, not a formatting artifact) - a percent
#      pattern of [\d.]+ alone silently fails to match these rows at all.
#   2. When one side of the comparison is a genuine swing between profit
#      and loss, DART reports a literal "흑자전환"/"적자전환" (swung to
#      profit / swung to loss) flag INSTEAD of a percentage, not alongside
#      one - confirmed live on Daeduck's and Hanmi's operating-profit
#      rows. A swing is always Section 5.4 SIGNAL-worthy (a profit/loss
#      swing is definitionally a >20% change; there is no finite
#      percentage to compute from a near-zero or negative base) - handled
#      as its own case, not coerced into a fake percentage number.

# examples had at least one real number). "억" and "조" are real Korean

    This is a DISTINCT mechanism from classify_rumour_adjudication's
    조회공시요구/답변 pair, confirmed via research 2026-09-23: introduced
    by KRX effective 2015-09-07, this is issued by the COMPANY on its own
    initiative, "without an exchange inquiry disclosure demand preceding
    it" - unlike 조회공시, which only exists because the exchange judged
    a rumour serious enough to compel a response. Korea Signals spec
    Section 5.6's "always SIGNAL" rule is justified specifically by that
    exchange compulsion ("The exchange itself judged the rumour serious
    enough to force an answer") - a justification that does not transfer
    to a company's own voluntary clarification, so this function
    deliberately does NOT reuse that rule wholesale rather than silently
    applying it to a mechanism the spec never described.

    Rule used here (not directly from the spec, since the spec never
    describes this mechanism - see reasoning above): a REAL, substantive
    denial of the specific claim is SIGNAL (real information the market
    didn't have before, even without exchange compulsion behind it) - a
    vague "under review, nothing decided yet" response is WEAK, matching
    the spirit of the spec's own 조회공시 rule ("nothing has been decided
    - which is the most common response, and says less") even though
    this isn't literally that rule. Confirmed live: 2 of 3 real examples
    are the vague case, 1 is a genuine denial (SK Hynix's Intel-Ohio-Fab
    denial) - both patterns are real, not hypothetical.

    Not yet confirmed (see research notes): whether any of the real
    해명 filings found actually had a preceding 조회공시요구 anyway (which
    would make them functionally answers in substance, filed under the
    voluntary form instead) - research could not verify this either way
    for the real examples checked.

    for GDELT, feedparser+_extract_body for RSS), so checking it costs

    checked against korean_name first (the common case), but an
    English-named mention (e.g. quoting an English-language exchange
    filing) still matches via company.

    Group-prefix exclusion (KOREA_TICKER_UNIVERSE's own exclude_terms,
    e.g. "Samsung Life"/"Samsung SDI" for 삼성전자) matters here exactly
    the way the spec's own Step 0 warns: Korean business groups share a
    name across many unrelated listed companies, so a bare group-prefix
    substring match would silently pull in the wrong firm. Checked against
    BOTH title and body, for the same reason the name check itself now
    covers both - an exclude_terms hit in the body is just as real a
    false-positive risk as one in the headline.

_QUALIFICATION_NEWS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You classify Korean market headlines about semiconductor and
electronics companies as HIGH or WEAK.

HIGH means the headline states a specific, checkable fact:
- a number (revenue, shipments, capacity, price, percentage)
- a named customer, partner, supplier or contract
- a result or stage change in an approval process
- a change in capacity, production, pricing or investment
- a forecast change stated by the company itself
- a government or regulatory action naming the company

WEAK means anything else:
- analyst opinion, ratings or price targets
- outlook or sentiment with no figure attached
- the company mentioned in passing in a market round-up
- a story mainly about a different company
- speculation attributed to unnamed sources

Who is speaking matters. A fact stated by the company, the
exchange or a regulator is HIGH. The same fact predicted by an
analyst is WEAK.

Approval of stacked memory at a customer is the most important
topic in this market. A headline stating an approval outcome, a
supply agreement or a volume for it is always HIGH.

If you are unsure, answer WEAK.

Example 1 - HIGH
  "SK Hynix begins volume supply of next-generation stacked
   memory to a major accelerator customer"
  Reason: a stage change in supply, plus a named customer type.

Example 2 - HIGH
  "Hanmi Semiconductor wins 48.5 billion won bonding equipment
   order"
  Reason: a specific contract value.

Example 3 - WEAK
  "Analysts expect the memory upcycle to continue into 2027"
  Reason: opinion, no figure, no company action.

Example 4 - WEAK
  "Korean chip shares rise on artificial intelligence optimism"
  Reason: sector sentiment, companies mentioned in passing.

Answer with one word only: HIGH or WEAK"""

    references them - the rule is purely "does this headline state a
    specific checkable fact") - they're sent as informational context per
    spec 8.2's literal input table, not because withholding them would
    make the model's own answer wrong. The SIGNAL/WEAK/NOISE table in
    spec 5.7 depends on the model's HIGH/WEAK answer, publication tier,
    and Filter 2 - not on these three fields - so their absence here has
    never affected classify_qualification_news's own final signal, only
    the model's context.

    (this module has no news-retrieval import - same boundary as every
    other classify_* function here, which read only what's already on the
    article's own metadata).

    Filter 1 (trusted publication): drop unless the article's own domain
    (derived from its url) is in _KOREA_TRUSTED_PUBLICATIONS.
    Filter 2 (company name in headline, extended to body): drop unless a
    tracked company's name appears in the title OR (as a live-confirmed
    extension past the spec's own headline-only wording, since a real
    story can name a tracked company/product only in the body while the
    headline stays generic) the body - _company_name_in_headline, whose
    own docstring explains why body is checked and how a body-only match
    is distinguished from a title match.
    Filter 3 (repeat story): count distinct publications carrying this
    story (own domain + also_reported_by) - not itself a drop condition
    per the spec's own wording ("keep the earliest") - since
    news-retrieval's title-similarity dedup (_dedup_by_title_similarity_for_domain,
    scoped to korea_market_signal) already drops the later near-duplicate
    articles upstream and folds their outlet into the survivor's
    also_reported_by list. This function's job is to read that count back
    out, not re-run the same dedup a second time.
    Model: one HIGH/WEAK call (spec 8.1-8.3) on whatever survives all
    three filters.

    Rule (spec Section 5.7's table):
      SIGNAL: model says HIGH, publication is first-tier, company-name
              check passed.
      WEAK:   model says HIGH but publication is second-tier, OR model
              says WEAK.
      NOISE:  removed by Filter 1, 2, or an empty/unparseable title before
              ever reaching the model - not returned as a classified
              result at all (mirrors Taiwan's classify_gdelt_articles,
              which likewise only returns rows for candidates that survive
              to the model call - a dropped-by-filter article was never a
              candidate, so there's nothing to insert a NOISE row for).

    Model-input wiring (spec Section 5.7's input fields / Section 8.2):
    publications_carrying_this is always computed and sent.
    english_coverage_found is computed from KOREA_GDELT_ENGLISH_SOURCE rows
    present in this SAME ``articles`` batch (via _english_coverage_pool -
    the same pool classify_korea_signal_batch's own _attach_english_coverage
    pass builds separately for the full result set) and sent when a match
    exists for the article's own ticker; None (omitted from the prompt) if
    no English-coverage data is available at all for this ticker in this
    batch - genuinely "not known", not "known to be false" (only
    classify_korea_signal_batch's later _attach_english_coverage pass, over
    the full result set, decides the stored false vs true - this function
    only ever sends what it can compute from the SAME batch, before that
    pass runs). price_move_today is never sent - see
    _classify_qualification_news_relevance's own docstring for why
    (a structural data-source gap, not a wiring gap). Neither field changes
    the Signal/Weak/Noise rule below - see that same function's docstring.
    Section 5.8's two override rules (already-moved price action, index-
    reweighting suppression) are also not implemented here - no
    price-move or index-membership data reaches this module today.

    ``context_articles``: already-stored kr_customs_export rows (as
    {"metadata": {...}} dicts - caller's own DB read shape, matching how
    rank_revenue_by_yoy's own context_articles are documented) covering
    at least the last ~13 periods per period_type, so a genuine YoY
    comparison and 12-period average/spread can be computed. Optional -
    omitting it means every article in this batch is classified against
    an empty history, which will correctly find no match for "same period
    one year ago" and produce nothing (see below) - not an error, just
    the same "not enough real data yet" outcome context_articles exists
    to eventually resolve.

    Per spec Section 5.1's own data-points table:
      - semiconductor export value for the period: metadata.
        semiconductor_export_usd_billion (10-day/20-day releases) OR
        derived from metadata.semiconductor_yoy_pct_stated directly
        (monthly CONFIRMED releases - see below, this is a genuinely
        different, BETTER data path for that one period_type)
      - period type: metadata.period_type ("10day"/"20day"/"monthly")
      - change against the same period one year earlier: computed here
      - average/spread over the last 12 equivalent periods: computed here
        from context_articles, grouped by period_type
      - how many spreads the current reading sits from the average:
        computed here

    Monthly releases are handled differently from 10-day/20-day: when a
    monthly post's own body already states a real semiconductor-specific
    YoY% (metadata.semiconductor_yoy_pct_stated - see news-retrieval's
    _extract_customs_figures), that stated value IS this function's own
    "change against the same period one year earlier" for that period,
    used directly rather than recomputed from two raw dollar figures -
    the source's own YoY% is a real, stated fact under the same
    "we do not have to guess" principle Section 5.2 states for supply
    contracts, not something to discard in favor of a self-computed
    figure when a genuine one already exists. A monthly post with a
    dollar figure but no stated YoY% (real, confirmed live - some monthly
    posts have one field but not the other) still needs a same-period-
    last-year dollar reading to compute YoY the normal way; if neither
    path has what it needs, that period contributes nothing (see below).

    The rule (spec's own table):
      SIGNAL - the reading sits more than 2 spreads from its 12-period
               average, in either direction, OR the YoY change is
               negative (regardless of spread distance - shrinking
               exports are rare enough in this cycle to matter on their
               own, per the spec's own reasoning)
      WEAK   - between 1 and 2 spreads away
      NOISE  - within 1 spread (the series behaving normally)

    A period contributes NO result at all (not NOISE, not anything) when
    either precondition is unmet: no same-period-one-year-ago reading
    exists in context_articles, or fewer than
    _EXPORT_SURPRISE_MIN_HISTORY_PERIODS prior equivalent periods exist to
    compute a real average/spread from. Confirmed live 2026-09-23: with
    real history reaching back only to ~2026-02, BOTH preconditions
    currently fail for every real period_type that exists - this function
    is expected to return [] against real data today, not a bug, an
    honest reflection of Section 5.1's own build note ("this rule needs
    two years of stored history before it means anything") - see this
    module's own docstring for the real, current depth.

    Taiwan's classify_taiwan_signal_batch, minus the revenue re-ranking
    machinery Korea has no equivalent of (no signal type here needs
    already-stored context the way rank_revenue_by_yoy's "top 3 of 20"
    does - every Korea classifier judges each article/filing against
    fixed thresholds or its own filing body, never against a field of
    peers), so this returns a plain list, not a (results, changed_context)
    tuple.

    ``tracked_companies``: caller's own KOREA_TICKER_UNIVERSE-shaped list
    ({"ticker", "company", "korean_name", "group_prefix", "exclude_terms",
    ...} per entry, news-retrieval seed.py's own shape) - this module has
    no news-retrieval import, so the caller (controllers/run.py) is
    responsible for fetching/passing this. Used directly by
    classify_qualification_news (S7, needs the full entry - exclude_terms,
    korean_name, company together); classify_supply_contract (S2) wants a
    flatter {name: ticker}-shaped map instead (see its own docstring), so
    this function derives that shape here rather than changing S2's
    existing, already-verified signature. Optional - omitting it just
    means S2's tracked-counterparty check and all of S7 are skipped
    (S7 structurally cannot run without it - Filter 2 has nothing to match
    against), matching classify_supply_contract's own "omit for percentage-
    only" fallback.

    Runs classifiers in report_nm-title order, not calling every function
    on every article: each classify_* function already narrows to its own
    title pattern internally (see each one's own docstring - "only touches
    articles whose title contains ..."), so calling all of them against
    the full pooled batch is correct and cheap, not wasteful - an article
    that doesn't match a given classifier's pattern is a no-op call, same
    as Taiwan's classify_material_announcements being called against
    mops_revenue rows it will never touch.

    S1 (export surprise) is NOT called here - not yet implemented (see
    module docstring: needs a 2yr history backfill this module doesn't
    have yet). kr_customs_export articles pooled into ``articles`` simply
