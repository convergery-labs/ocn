"""Orchestration - daily SEC filing classification job.

Mirrors controllers/run.py's shape (create job -> classify concurrently ->
persist -> mark complete) but for SEC filings: read each tracked ticker's
recent filing metadata from news-retrieval (adapters/news_client.get_sec_filings
-> GET /market/sec-filings/{ticker}), which news-retrieval's own daily poller
fetches from SEC EDGAR and stores in DynamoDB. This service never calls
EDGAR's submissions API directly - only the filing body text (fetch_filing_text
below) is fetched here, since news-retrieval stores metadata + a link only.

One CloudWatch schedule triggers this directly (see infra/modules/ecs_cluster),
timed to run after news-retrieval's own sec_filings poller (01:00 UTC daily) -
there is no push/fire-and-forget step between the two services. The ticker
universe (get_tracked_tickers) is likewise read live from news-retrieval
rather than duplicated, since that list is its single source of truth.

    Returns (text, extraction_found, exhibit_fetch_status). exhibit_fetch_status
    is only meaningful for 8-Ks carrying an exhibit-fetch-eligible item code
    (see sec_edgar._EXHIBIT_FETCH_ITEM_CODES): "full" (every referenced EX-99*
    exhibit fetched), "partial" (index fetch or an exhibit fetch failed, or no
    EX-99* exhibit was listed at all despite an eligible item code). Every
    other filing (10-K/10-Q, or an 8-K with no eligible item code) gets
    "not_applicable" - passed straight through to the prompt so the model
    knows whether "not_applicable" means "no fetch was warranted" versus
    "full"/"partial" meaning a fetch was attempted (10-K/10-Q's own
    extraction_found already covers whether ITS OWN text was usable, tracked
    separately as the returned bool).

    10-K/10-Q use extract_filing_sections (results-of-operations + qualitative
    notes on income taxes/contingencies/debt), not the full ~100K-500K char
    document. History here: first tried extract_results_section alone (just
    the numbers window) for 10-Q - real ~85% cost cut, $0.13 -> $0.02/call -
    but reverted after confirming on a real AAPL 10-Q that window dropped a
    genuinely material EU State Aid legal matter living in a different note,
    and the model's own signal_reason flipped from "not a routine in-line
    quarter" to "routine periodic filing" on the identical filing once that
    context was cut. extract_filing_sections adds the qualitative notes back
    (found via "Note N - Title" headers, which generalize across filers even
    though note numbering doesn't) - confirmed to restore the State Aid
    content while still cutting the same AAPL 10-Q by 82.5% (170K -> 30K
    chars), since the numeric tables that pad out the rest of the document
    are no longer needed in prose - see xbrl_facts below for why.

    8-K: the cover-page primary document rarely carries the actual figures
    for 2.02 (earnings)/7.01 (Reg FD)/8.01 (other events) - those live in an
    attached EX-99* exhibit instead. Confirmed empirically this session:
    every real 2.02 filing classified so far was scored noise with a reason
    like "figures are in Exhibit 99.1 which is not included", because only
    the primary doc was ever fetched. For those item codes, fetch the
    exhibit(s) too and append to the primary doc's text; other item codes
    (e.g. 5.02, 5.07) are typically self-contained on the cover page and
    don't warrant the extra EDGAR round-trip.
