# intermittent rather than reproducible from the event shape alone - the
# validator correctly rejects it, but the event is then silently
# dropped with no fallback (see interpret_event's own no-retry
# rationale). Falls back to SEC_FILING_MODEL instead - a stronger model
# already proven reliable for this codebase's other structured-JSON
# extraction call, not the cheaper V2 tier Taiwan's forced-one-word
# calls use (a wrong word there just means "safely defaults to WEAK";

# OPENAI_MODEL_V2 (gpt-4o-mini) reliably fabricated numbers when asked to
# restate already-final classified data (WATCHING day-counts, INDUSTRY
